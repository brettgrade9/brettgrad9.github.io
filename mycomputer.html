## Commentary
I have had this computer since the summer of 2020 and used it for one year of online school. It is very good for school work and watching movies and shows. It's also very portable and easy to bring on a plain or in the car. However, it isn't good for playing very complicated video games and has gotten very hot when I tried to before.
